command="docker-compose logs -f"

    You will have to manually launch the following commands:
        \$ cd /home/wwwroot/sf4
        \$ composer create-project symfony/skeleton my-temp-folder

    When itâ€™s done, we will get the project to the root path.
        \$ cp -Rf /home/wwwroot/sf4/my-temp-folder/. .
        \$ rm -Rf /home/wwwroot/sf4/my-temp-folder
        \$ chown -R www-data:www-data *

    Finally type 'exit' to return to this tutorial

    Notice that you can't authenticate to it using server/login/password mysql/sf4/sf4
    defined in the docker-compose.yml file
    we will see in the next exercise how to correct this
