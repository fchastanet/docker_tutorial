    check the file 'exercises/02-docker-compose/exo02/.docker/apache/Dockerfile'
    and notice how it has been reworked
    - group of all the commands in one layer to avoid cache effect
    - cleaning at the end of the layer to reduce image size
    - one apt package by line and sorted alphabetically for easier merging
    - same best practice for apache module (a2enmod command)

    check the file 'exercises/02-docker-compose/exo02/.docker/php/Dockerfile'
    and notice how it has been reworked
    - group of all the commands in one layer to avoid cache effect
    - gosu command added via multi-stage builds
    - composer command added via official composer image
    - cleaning at the end of the layer to reduce image size
    - one apt package by line and sorted alphabetically for easier merging
    - note that there is too much apt packages and some of them could be removed (to be analysed)
    - cleaning packages in the same layer, otherwise it doesn't clean anything
    - custom entrypoint configuration
    - files .docker/php/php.ini and .docker/php/php-fpm-pool.conf are simply mounted via
      volume mapping inside docker-compose.yml instead of being copied via image building
      it allows you to modify these files without the need of rebuilding the image
      moreover in the first version, the COPY instruction was before some layers, if it was updated
      the subsequent layers would have been invalidated and rebuilt

    here we are creating .env file
    all the variables defined in this file are available in the docker-compose.yml file
    and are passed to the container as environment variables via environment instruction

    commands id -u and id -g gives current user/group id

    under windows 1000 default value is used, the files shared between host and container
    are world writable anyway, chmod on windows files has no effect

    You will have to manually launch the following commands:
        \$ cd /home/wwwroot/sf4
        \$ composer create-project symfony/skeleton my-temp-folder

    When itâ€™s done, we will get the project to the root path.
        \$ cp -Rf /home/wwwroot/sf4/my-temp-folder/. .
        \$ rm -Rf /home/wwwroot/sf4/my-temp-folder
        \$ chown -R www-data:www-data *
